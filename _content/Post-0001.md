The Erasmus program is something that changed my life. And I want to tell you why.

## How things started

I've always been attracted to this program. The opportunity to travel, go far from home, and experience a new culture among new people is one of the most exciting things a young adult can do. Unfortunately, not everyone does an Erasmus. Some people don't because they can't afford it. Others can't waste time and need to graduate as quickly as possible. I was among both groups. I had no money and no time to lose, so I never really considered it an option in my life.

One day, in what was supposed to be my final year, I was studying for an exam. As usual, I opened my phone, read the notifications, scrolled through social media, replied to a few texts, and cleared my unread emails. I read one titled "Call for international mobility." The administration office of my university had sent an informative email about the Erasmus program. It contained a series of "How to..." guides explaining how to participate, enroll, and what timelines to follow if you wanted to apply. In the guide, I read about some financial support meant to contribute to rent and living expenses during the six months abroad. I couldn't believe someone would give me money to go abroad. This would have removed me from the category of those who couldn't afford it. The only thing still holding me back was the time I would lose. I was sure if I went abroad, all my academic commitments would remain, extending my time at university and delaying my entry into the adult world. I was planning to get a degree as quickly as possible, get a job with a good salary, and finally become independent from my family.

I started convincing myself that if I ever went, I would study twice as hard. I would select the "exams + thesis" option and complete my entire master's degree program in the last six months without exceeding the normal expected time. I delved into the links and guides, attended information meetings, and filled out the application form, indicating my preferences. I already had a clear idea of my destination, even though there were many options available. Since middle school, thanks to my French language teacher, I had developed a curiosity, fascination, and admiration for French culture and France in general. There were several universities available in France, so I chose three that seemed the best fit for my academic path and submitted my application.

That was one of the best things I could have done in my life. I had fallen in love with the idea of having a new experience, and I could already picture myself there, a few kilometers from Paris, living something exciting. In the following weeks, I completed all the necessary bureaucratic procedures, talked to some professors, organized my trip, and bought the tickets. I got in touch with two girls from another university who would be doing the same Erasmus program. I had found them in a Facebook group. I was ready to go.

## The departure

It was the end of January. I had organized everything: the residence, the trip, and made some contacts for when I arrived. A few months earlier, the Milan-Paris train route had been inaugurated. So, I could leave with my two suitcases on a comfortable train and arrive at my destination in about six hours, something I was used to doing when traveling between Naples and Milan. I was about to go to another country for the first time. I would arrive and not understand the language of the people around me. I was very excited. I left early in the morning. I remember because the metro wasn't open yet. I took a car-sharing vehicle, loaded it with my suitcases, and drove to Milan Central Station. I was used to taking trains, so without too many surprises or difficulties, I found myself on the train, in the early morning silence, looking out the window at the snowy mountain landscapes from one of the four seats around a small table. I frequently checked the map to notice the moment I crossed the border. I imagined something would happen. Seeing things I'd never seen before, hearing sounds I'd never heard before, feeling different. But it didn't seem like that at the moment when the train crossed the border. The uniform of the policeman who checked my documents shortly after entering France was a bit different from the Italian ones I was used to, but not that much. There was a girl my age sitting across from me. She was studying some slides, and I noticed the name of my university. Generally, I don't talk to strangers, but this was the beginning of a new adventure for me, so I felt justified in exchanging a few words. We started talking about the Politecnico. In a short time, I discovered that she was also going for a six-month study period in Paris, at a different university north of the capital. We somehow connected and became travel companions, exchanging contacts in case we ever needed each other. When the train arrived at its destination, everything happened very quickly. Together with my new friend, we bought tickets, found the departure gate for our respective trains, and said goodbye. I never saw that girl again.

## The arrival

I was on the train connecting the central station of Paris to the small suburban station where my university was located. Then it would be about a 10-minute walk. I was very excited. I arrived at the destination station and headed for the exit. It was broad daylight, it had rained a little before but the sun was shining at that moment. The air was fresh. It wasn't like the central station of Paris. There were far fewer people, just me and a few others who had gotten off the same train. They knew where to go and quickly disappeared within a few minutes. I took out the map again, studied the route, and set off on foot. There were many trees and some low, white buildings. A few cars passed by, but not too many. I had my two heavy suitcases, which weren't very easy to carry. The sidewalk was narrow and often nonexistent, but there weren't many cars passing by. I remember crossing a highway through a pedestrian underpass. There were some graffiti, a few pieces of litter along the edges, and little light. Once I got through the underpass, I was practically at my destination.

Around me were slightly taller buildings, about four floors high. They were a bit old, dark gray. These were the seven university residence buildings. I saw a few boys and girls walking as if they knew exactly where they were going. I, on the other hand, didn't yet know where to go, but I saw a sign that said "Accueil." That's where I needed to go; I had read it in some informational email. There was a revolving door that blocked access to those without a badge. I didn't have one, but someone passing by said something I didn't understand and used their badge to let me in. There was no one around, but I saw a small glass door with "Accueil" written on it. I went in, introduced myself, showed my documents, completed the payment for which I had already left a deposit online, received a key, some brochures, and went back out. I had arrived. I had paid for my first month of stay and had the keys to my room in hand. Now, I needed to find building number 7 and locate room 7533 on the fifth floor. 

In the meantime, I was talking on WhatsApp with one of the two girls I had previously met through a Facebook group who were also doing the same Erasmus program at the same university. She had already arrived and settled in, knew everything, and offered to welcome me and show me to my room. I waited for her for a few minutes. I saw her approaching from a distance. She was blonde, with a smile on her face. We introduced ourselves, shared our journeys, and our first impressions. She seemed a bit clumsy but was nice. Little did I know that she would become one of my best friends, even today. We went to the building and the floor where my room was and discovered we were neighbors. She was in room 7534. We were still looking around, and I was dragging my two heavy suitcases, talking to the blonde girl when the elevator behind us opened noisily. A very pretty girl stepped out, quickly made eye contact with us, and then continued towards her room, not far from ours. She probably realized we were international students because she heard us speaking Italian. She approached us and kindly asked in English if we needed any help. She spoke English very well, without any accent unlike us; she was from Madrid and had arrived a few days earlier. She was also on Erasmus. We exchanged numbers, and she added us to a group with other international students. We parted ways with the promise to meet again that evening. I also said goodbye to the blonde girl, with whom I would take a tour of the residences and the university in the afternoon after settling in, and opened the door to my room. It was very bright, nice, and I liked it. The kitchen was perhaps a bit too small. I left my suitcases, closed the door, lay down on the bed, and finally felt relaxed. I had made it. I had really started my Erasmus. I had overcome all the necessary steps and procedures. I was about to live abroad for a while.

## The beginning

That evening, I went to our first party with the blonde girl. There were already about 15 international students, and more would arrive in the coming days. Everyone was very welcoming, and within a few minutes, I had almost talked to everyone with my very rusty English. A bit of beer was necessary to loosen up and be able to dance with these people in a venue within the campus itself, full of people from my new university. In those days, I met many people and formed bonds that would last throughout the Erasmus program and beyond.

## The best part

The laughter. The situation was comical from the start. The food we ate made us laugh. The smells we encountered made us laugh. The stench of wet carpet was a source of childish jokes every time we went for breakfast at the café or came out of a class. Classes had never been so interesting. But the best part was the trips to Paris. We organized in groups, sometimes too large, running after trains that were even more delayed than we were. The destinations varied. During the day, we visited the city: the museums, parks, neighborhoods, gardens, monuments. Picnics at the Eiffel Tower. Picnics on the hill of Montmartre. The music festival. The visit to Versailles. A day at Disneyland Paris. The gay pride parade. The many events. The train trips in other french cities. The volleybal matches in the golden hour. The lunches and dinners often prepared and eaten together. The barbecues. In the evenings, we usually went to parties organized in bars or clubs, often ending in scenes at the edge of legality. It was impossible not to connect with the people around us. We were all friends. A group of people protecting each other, a balance of laughter, respect, cordiality, differences, gossip, quarrels, and strong emotions.

Every place was amazing. Every day, I was surprised. Each of those days was a bundle of new sensations. New ways of seeing the same world and new worlds to see.

## The end

The days of Erasmus passed, and not even too slowly. Those six months were intense. Almost every day was filled with a new and different adventure. In normal life, that time equates to about three years. Yet even three years pass. June arrived without anyone noticing. The first departure made some of us cry. Others followed. Sometimes we accompanied those leaving to the airport while organizing the last big events to conclude that period in style. The last parties, the last hugs. We all felt deeply moved. We knew we were losing something unique that we wouldn't easily find again in the future. We knew that even if we met those same people again for a coffee in a different city, it wouldn't be the same. There wouldn't be the same strong connection. The moment came when I too had teary eyes for a few minutes. I returned by train in the same way I had left, accompanied by two girls who would take a different path once we reached Milan. We said goodbye, holding on to the memories, the photos, fading our connection via chat on social media.

## What remains

Few years have passed since that experience. Those were the six months of my life when I felt the most alive. More free. Happier. I felt in the right place.

I noticed that the awareness of living with a near expiration date was one of the reasons why I lived every moment as intensely as possible. That time was short, and it would have been a shame to waste it. Those people were just passing through my life, so it was worth saying things right away, connecting immediately to have a good time together. And in the end, that's what life is like. One, short, made up of moments you can choose to live or to waste.
